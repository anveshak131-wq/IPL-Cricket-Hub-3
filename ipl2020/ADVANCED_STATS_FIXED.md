# ✅ Advanced Stats Page - Fixed

## 🎯 Problem Identified

The advanced-stats.html page had **prediction content mixed with statistics**, which was confusing and not working properly.

**Issues:**
- ML prediction content (Neural Networks, Random Forest, LSTM)
- "AI POWERED INSIGHTS" section with prediction models
- Technical accuracy metrics (87.3%, 92%, 78%)
- "Machine Learning Predictions" heading
- "Prediction" references everywhere

**Result:** Page was confusing - statistics mixed with predictions that don't work.
