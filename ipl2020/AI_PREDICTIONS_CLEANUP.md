# ✅ AI Predictions Page - Cleanup Complete

## 🗑️ What Was Removed

### **Technical ML Models Section (DELETED)**
The following unprofessional, overly-technical content was removed:

❌ **Random Forest Classifier**
- "Ensemble learning method using 500+ decision trees..."
- Accuracy: 82.4%, F1 Score: 0.81

❌ **Neural Network (LSTM)**
- "Deep learning model with Long Short-Term Memory networks..."
- Accuracy: 78.9%, Loss: 0.42

❌ **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**
- "XGBoost implementation optimizing match predictions..."
- Accuracy: 80.2%, AUC-ROC: 0.85

❌ **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- "SVM with RBF kernel classifying teams..."
- Accuracy: 76.8%, Precision: 0.79

❌ **Ensemble Voting**
- "Meta-model combining predictions from multiple algorithms..."
- Accuracy: 84.1%, Confidence: 92%

❌ **Naive Bayes**
- "Probabilistic classifier using Bayes' theorem..."
- Accuracy: 72.3%, Speed: Fast

### **Why This Was Wrong:**
- ❌ Too technical for cricket fans
- ❌ Algorithm names mean nothing to users
- ❌ F1 Score, AUC-ROC, Loss metrics are confusing
- ❌ Not relevant to cricket experience
- ❌ Makes the site feel like a data science project, not a sports platform
