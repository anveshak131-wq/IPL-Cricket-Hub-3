# ✅ AI Predictions Page - Final Cleanup Complete

## 🗑️ All Technical/Unprofessional Content Removed

### **1. Machine Learning Models Section** ❌ DELETED
- Random Forest Classifier
- Neural Network (LSTM)  
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
- Support Vector Machine
- Ensemble Voting
- Naive Bayes

**Why removed:** Too technical, confusing algorithm names, not relevant for cricket fans

---

### **2. Model Performance Over Time** ❌ DELETED
- Chart tracking prediction accuracy across seasons
- Technical performance metrics

**Why removed:** Users don't care about model accuracy history, they want match predictions

---

### **3. Feature Importance Analysis** ❌ DELETED
- Technical bars showing feature scores (0.28, 0.22, etc.)
- ML-specific importance metrics

**Why removed:** Confusing technical scores, not cricket-focused

---

### **4. Upcoming Match Predictions (Fake Data)** ❌ DELETED
- Fake matches (MI vs CSK, RCB vs KKR)
- Made-up predictions with no real fixtures

**Why removed:** Shows fake data when no fixtures exist, misleading users
