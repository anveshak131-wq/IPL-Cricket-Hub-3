# ✅ "Feature Importance Analysis" - REMOVED

## Status: DELETED ✅

The confusing "Feature Importance Analysis" section has been **completely removed** from all pages.

---

## What It Was (Confusing & Technical):

### **The Deleted Section:**
```
❌ "Feature Importance Analysis"
   "Key factors influencing match predictions"

   Team Form (Last 5 Matches): 0.28
   Head-to-Head Record: 0.22
   Player Performance Index: 0.19
   Venue Statistics: 0.15
   Pitch Conditions: 0.10
   Weather Impact: 0.06
```

### **Why It Was Confusing:**
- ❌ Technical ML term ("Feature Importance")
- ❌ Decimal scores (0.28, 0.22) mean nothing to cricket fans
- ❌ Looks like code/data science, not cricket
- ❌ Doesn't explain anything useful
